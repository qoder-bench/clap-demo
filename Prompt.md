# New Requirement

Add a `login` subcommand to `main.rs` for user login. Requirements:

- Subcommand name is `login`
- Two required parameters: `username` and `password`
- After the subcommand matches, print `User {username} logged in with password {password}`


# Build Optimization

This is a command-line program, and I want the compiled executable to be as small as possible.
Please help me optimize `Cargo.toml` and `main.rs` to reduce the size of the final binary file.
